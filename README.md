# work-day-scheduler-challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a scheduler for the days I work. I also want this to be a sample project for anyone interested in learning JavaScript. I built this project because I wanted to practice using DayJS and other APIs. The scheduler will keep track of the time for students or professionals who wish to improve time management skills. I learned lots about local storage, how to use DayJS, and other APIs.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this scheduler, type in your event at the designated time. When you click save, the event will save for you. The colors of the time blocks will change as the day goes on.
